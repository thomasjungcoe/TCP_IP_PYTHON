IP Address
    *   A unique string of numbers separated by full stops that identifies each computer using the Internet Protocol 
        to communicate over a network.

Public vs Private IP
    *   router Wi-Fi IP vs ISP (Vodafone and AT & T)
    *   Finding out both IP addresses -
        -   Public IP - Google "Whats my IP"
        -   Private IP - Windows (ipconfig), Linux or Mac (ifconfig)

Static vs Dynamic IP
    *   Static IP addresses never change
    *   Dynamic IP addresses always keep changing
        - restarting pc will show you change in IP for the Dynamic IP
    
    *   Static - Servers and website
    *   Dynamic - Computer and mobile devices
    
    *   How to find static IP address of website
        -   ping google.com -> will give you ip address and type the ip to go to google.

Port
    *   IP Adress represents city whereas Port # represent exact house you live in.
        - netstat -a -b -n (need admin right)
    *   Think about port as exact room number.

Sockets
    *   A socket is one endpoint of a two-way communication link between two programs running on the network.
        A socket is bound to a port number so that the TCP layer can identify the application that data is destined to be sent to.
        An endpoint is a combination of an IP address and a port number.

    *   socket.socket()     - create socket
    *   s.bind(host,port)   - bind socket
    *   s.send()            - send a message
    *   s.listen()          - listening to the communication
    *   s.recv()            - receiveing the message
    *   s.close()           - closing the socket.

Direct and Reverse Connections
    How the connection happans? -- Direct Connection
        1) Host / IP Addresss + Port 
        2) Socket

    Problems with direct connection
        * It is difficult to get IP address
        * Even if we get his IP address, the IP address is Dynamic IP so its always changing
        * Even we could get regular updates to the Dynamic IP address, the computer has bunch of firewalls, 
            which makes it impossible to get into that computer.

    Reverse Connection
        * python file that does reverse shell script -> attach ip address and port of the hacker's pc and send it via email or via usb?
            then whene victom opens the file, it creates a reverse connection to the hacker's computer.

Server
    * Remote computer when you can store files or host websites
    * It has a static IP address
    * You need internet to access this remote computer

Reverse shell
    *   way to connect into anyone's computer using Reverse shell
    *   one of the hecker's tool

    server.py       ->  client.py 
    cloud server    ->  friend's pc
